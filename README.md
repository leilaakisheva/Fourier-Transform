# Fourier-Transform
This assignment involves generating a signal of the given form, and visualizing it in the time and frequency domain. I will be computing the Fourier Transform of the signal and observing the retrieved frequencies. Additionally, I will be applying the inverse Fourier Transform to the signal and comparing it with the original signal. 
## Introduction
Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique used to decompose a signal into its individual frequency components. It is widely used in various fields such as signal processing, communication systems, and image processing. In this assignment, we will be working with regularly sampled data and using the Fourier Transform to retrieve the signal characteristics.
